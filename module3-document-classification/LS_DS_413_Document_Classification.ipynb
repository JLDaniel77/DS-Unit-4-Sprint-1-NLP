    "Sklearn pipelines allow you to stitch together multiple components of a machine learning process. The idea is that you can pass you raw data and get predictions out of the pipeline. This ability to pass raw input and receive a prediction from a singular class makes pipelines well suited for production, because you can pickle a a pipeline without worry about other data preprocessing steps.
